## 📏 What is ZenMaster?

ZenMaster is an **AI article factory** that creates thousands of high-quality articles for Яндекс Дзен. Think of it like:

- **Input**: A theme ("I suffered for 20 years") + archetype ("Comeback Queen") + tone ("confessional")
- **Processing**: AI generates an article with 15,000+ characters (30-40 minute read)
- **Output**: Ready-to-publish article with images, formatted for Дзен

**Current Capability**: 1-100 articles per run, with images, quality assurance

## 🎬 How It Works: 4 Main Stages

### Stage 0: Outline Engineering (5 minutes per article)

**What happens**: AI reads your theme and creates a "story blueprint"

**Example**:
```
Theme: "I was the worst daughter-in-law until one day"
      ⭙
Outline (from AI):
  Part 1: Mother-in-law mocked me in front of everyone
  Part 2: I decided to leave and start my own business
  Part 3: First 3 months - despair and tears
  Part 4: First 6 months - first clients appear
  Part 5: 12 months later - I'm making 500K/month
  Part 6: Mother-in-law calls asking for a job
  Part 7: I offer her a job... but on MY terms
```

**Why this matters**:
- Prevents random, incoherent stories
- Ensures arc from suffering → action → victory
- Creates "open loops" (reader keeps scrolling)
