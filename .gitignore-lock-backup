# NOTE: package-lock.json needs to be regenerated
# Run this command locally:
# npm install
# git add package-lock.json
# git commit -m "Regenerate package-lock.json with all dependencies"
# git push

# The lock file must contain ALL dependencies for npm ci to work.
# This is a one-time action needed after updating package.json.
