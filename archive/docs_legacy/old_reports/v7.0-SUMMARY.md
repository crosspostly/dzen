# 🧾 v7.0 Summary (Compressed)

This is a **compressed** summary of ZenMaster **v7.0** changes.

> Full implementation notes (root): [`IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY-v7.0.md`](../../IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY-v7.0.md)

---

## Problem addressed

- Articles were getting corrupted by anti-detection and cleanup layers
- Pipeline felt too complex; users wanted a direct prompt approach
- Strict requirement: **first-person narration always**

---

## Key features

### 1) Simplified generation mode

New CLI flags:

- `--no-anti-detection` — disables Phase 2 processing
- `--no-cleanup` — skips cleanup gates

Example:

```bash
npx ts-node cli.ts factory --count=1 --no-anti-detection --no-cleanup --theme="Тема"
```

### 2) New “simple” generators

- `SimpleEpisodeGenerator`
  - one clean prompt
  - no Phase 2 / no cleanup
  - enforces first-person

- `SimpleArticleGenerator`
  - full article generation in one flow
  - designed for clean output without extra processing

### 3) Config wiring + backward compatibility

- New options in configs/options:
  - `useAntiDetection?: boolean`
  - `skipCleanupGates?: boolean`
- Full mode remains the default; no breaking changes

---

## Files added (high level)

- `services/simpleEpisodeGenerator.ts`
- `services/simpleArticleGenerator.ts`
- tests for simplified mode
- `docs/v7.0-simplified-generation.md`
- `docs/v7.0-quick-start.md`

---

## Performance outcome (reported)

- Full mode: ~55 ops / 5–7 min per article
- Simplified mode: ~10 ops / 2–3 min per article

---

## Notes

If you see text artifacts again, start by running in simplified mode (`--no-anti-detection --no-cleanup`) and only re-enable gates if needed.
